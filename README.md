# TL,DR

We are using a version of React containing `React hooks` 
we have no need for defining `objects with methods`, 
and have no concrete use for the `ES6 class syntax`.

## Front-end
[React Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html)

## Mock server
- [json-server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server)
